# README

This app was created with Rails using the google maps API.
Create an account, make an event, connect it to an existing
location or make a new location. Comment on events that you
are attending or have attended. RSVP to an event. If you created
an event and it has happened already, you can let the app
know who showed up! Favorite locations to be able to quickly
find them.
